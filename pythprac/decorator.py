# In Python, a function can be wrapped with a decorator using the @decorator syntax. This is also known as "decorator syntax" or "pie syntax".

# Here's an example of how a function can be wrapped with a decorator:

def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("After the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

say_hello()

# In this example, we define a decorator function my_decorator, which takes a function as an argument and returns a new function wrapper that adds some extra functionality to the original function.

# The @my_decorator syntax is used to wrap the say_hello() function with the my_decorator() decorator. This means that when say_hello() is called, it will be executed by the wrapper function returned by my_decorator(), which adds some extra functionality before and after the original function is called.

# When the say_hello() function is called, the output will be:

# This shows that the say_hello() function has been wrapped with the my_decorator() decorator, which has added some extra functionality to it.

# In summary, a function can be wrapped with a decorator in Python using the @decorator syntax, which applies the decorator to the function at the time of definition. When the decorated function is called, it is executed by the wrapper function returned by the decorator, which adds some extra functionality to it
